# Brain-tumor-detection-using-ResUNet

Brain tumor is a serious disease occurring in human being. Medical treatment process
mainly depends on tumor types and its location. The final decision of neurospecial-
ists and radiologist for the tumor diagnosis mainly depend on evaluation of Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) Images. The manual evaluation process is time-consuming
and needs domain expertise to avoid human errors. To overcome this issue Convo-
lution Neural Network (CNN) deep learning algorithm based on ResUNet architec-
ture is proposed for detecting the tumor and marking the area of their occurrence.
There are several advantages to using these proposed architectures for segmentation
tasks. First, a residual unit helps when training deep architectures. Second, feature
accumulation with recurrent residual convolutional layers ensures better feature rep-
resentation for segmentation tasks.The automatic brain tumor classification is very
challenging task in large spatial and structural variability of surrounding region of
brain tumor. The method proposed accuracy 96% on the test data.
